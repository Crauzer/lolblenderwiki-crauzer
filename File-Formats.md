There are a few different types of file formats used by Riot Games in League of Legends.

* [.SKN files](https://github.com/lispascal/lolblender/wiki/LoL-Mesh-File-Format-(.SKN)) are mesh files that define a mesh for a character. It contains a list of vertices and a list of triangular faces, along with some meta-data. 
* [.SKL files](https://github.com/lispascal/lolblender/wiki/LoL-Skeleton-File-Format-(.SKL)) are skeleton files that define a skeleton or armature for a character. It contains a list of "bones", with positions, orientations, connections, and perhaps some other data.
* .ANM files are animation files that specify an animation of a character. They contain the positions of a set of bones for a set amount of frames.
* .DDS files are common texture files, not a format used only by Riot Games.
